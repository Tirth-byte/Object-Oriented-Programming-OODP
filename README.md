This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It is designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand how OOP is implemented in C++ through clear explanations and practical examples.

The code follows standard C++ practices and focuses on building a strong foundation in OOP.

🎯 Objectives

Understand core OOP principles

Learn how to design programs using classes and objects

Practice writing clean, modular, and reusable C++ code

Prepare for college exams, interviews, and competitive programming basics

🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Constructors and Destructors

Access Specifiers (public, private, protected)

Static Members

Virtual Functions

Function Overloading & Operator Overloading
